# CitiBike

### Spring 2015 Prototype Goals
#### le data
* [Link to the dataset](http://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data)
* Data should be put into a local /data folder (covered by the .gitignore).
* Naming convention for data files: **CitiBike[startmonth][endmonth][year].csv**
* For example, the data filename for the "Download data from Oct - Dec 2013..." option on citibikenyc.com would be CitiBikeOctDec2013.csv

####Individual explorations (on separate branches of the repo)
* Where do bikes live? Gather some insights for the punchline discussion on January 31.
* Explore tools such as ipython notebooks, interactive widgets, seaborn, d3, etc.
* Scope and reflect appropriately! Be open minded and take notes on what worked well, what didn't work well, first impressions, etc. :)
